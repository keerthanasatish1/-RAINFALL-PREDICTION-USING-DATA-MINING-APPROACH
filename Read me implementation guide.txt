1.rainfall Prediction for consecutive years

RainfallTrain.mat contains training data for the code.
RainfallTest.mat contains test data for the code.
RainfallFuture.mat contains test data to predict future rainfall for next few dates.
Main.m contains the main code for the program.
FeatureNormalize.m is used for Feature Normalization.
gradientDescent.m is used for Rainfall Prediction via Gradient Descent by linear regression method.
predictrain.m % is used to predict the rain via the theta's obtained from gradient descent.
Rain.m calculates the Rain value.

Steps for execution:
1. Double click on Main.m to launch matlab code.
2. Click on Run icon under home tab.
3. Wait till graphs are displayed.Graphs were plotted for actual forecast (obtained from dataset) and each algorithms separately. 
   Also another graph is plotted for knowing how much the Prediction error is.
   Here graphs are plotted for years 2014-2017  
4. Check command window for accuracy and error Percentages.

2.rainfall Prediction for Random years data.

RainfallTrain.mat contains training data for the code.
